# transformer.jl
#
# A Transformer encoder stack as a single skill-jade-compliant kernel. All
# work (query/key/value projection, multi-head scaled dot-product
# attention, output projection, both residual-add-and-layer-norm steps,
# and the position-wise feed-forward block) is inlined into one function
# body; there are no helper functions to call. Every array is caller
# allocated and passed in; the kernel allocates nothing and returns
# nothing, writing its result into x in place.
#
# Pre-processing (token embedding, positional encoding) and post-
# processing (output head) are disregarded, per the request; x is taken
# to already be an embedded token sequence.
#
# Per-layer weights are passed as single flat arrays stacked over
# n_layers (e.g. wq has length n_layers*d*d; layer l's block starts at
# flat offset (l-1)*d*d), since a single kernel takes no structs.
#
# x: input/output array of length n*d, row-major (token t, dim c at
#    (t-1)*d+c), overwritten in place with the encoder-stack output
# wq, bq, wk, bk, wv, bv, wo, bo: self-attention parameters stacked over
#    n_layers (wq/wk/wv/wo length n_layers*d*d, bq/bk/bv/bo length n_layers*d)
# ln1_gain, ln1_bias: first layer-norm parameters, length n_layers*d
# w1, b1, w2, b2: feed-forward parameters (w1 length n_layers*d*dff, b1
#    length n_layers*dff, w2 length n_layers*dff*d, b2 length n_layers*d)
# ln2_gain, ln2_bias: second layer-norm parameters, length n_layers*d
# q, k, v: scratch arrays of length n*d for the projected query/key/value
# scores, probs: scratch arrays of length h*n*n -- one private n*n slice
#    per head for that head's raw scores and attention weights
# ctx: scratch array of length n*d for the concatenated head outputs
# attn_out: scratch array of length n*d for the attention output projection
# resid1, normed1: scratch arrays of length n*d for the first residual block
# ff_hidden: scratch array of length n*dff for the feed-forward hidden layer
# ff_out: scratch array of length n*d for the feed-forward output
# resid2: scratch array of length n*d for the second residual sum
# x_next: scratch array of length n*d holding each layer's freshly
#    computed output before it is copied back into x
# n: number of tokens in the sequence
# dk: per-head width
# h: number of attention heads
#    (the model width d is derived in the body as h*dk, not passed)
# dff: feed-forward hidden width
# n_layers: number of stacked encoder layers
# eps: layer-norm epsilon
